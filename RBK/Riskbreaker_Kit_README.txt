Description of the kit:
======================

Riskbreakers are quick and focused warriors. They have the ability to move and attack enemies in
a way that only a blurred outline of their bodies can be seen. Riskbreakers have limited access
to enhanced versions of a few mage spells as innate abilities which boost their quickness and
skills of disabling enemies during combats and to break the risk involved in most difficult
battles. They also have innate immunties to a number of most important spells and spell-like
effects which might hinder their swiftness of action. Only Humans can be Riskbreakers.

 
Advantages:
- Immunity to Web, Entangle, Slow, Hold, and Stun.
- Riskbreakers are so focused during battles that they make critical hits at a roll of 17 or better (instead of the usual 20).
- +1 bonus to Armor class at levels 10, 13, 16 ... etc.
- Gains "Improved Blur" and "Slow" at levels 5, 9, 13, ... etc.
- Gains "Hold Undead (enhanced)", "Hold Monster (enhanced)" and "Improved Haste" at levels 10, 15
  , 20, ... etc.
- Gains the innate ability "Risk Decrement" at levels 14, 20, 26, ... etc

Improved Blur:

Improved Blur has a shorter duration than normal Blur (10 rounds), but grants better protections
(+6 bonus to AC and +2 bonus to saves) and will not be dispellable by True Sight or Dispel Magic.

Hold undead (enhanced):
Riskbreaker's Hold undead has a shorter duration than the wizard version of the spell, but it
requires the target to roll a save vs spells with a -2 penalty. Its casting time is also shorter
than the wizard spell.

Hold Monster (enhanced):
Riskbreaker's Hold Monster has a shorter duration than the wizard version of the spell, but it
requires the target to roll a save vs spells with a -4 penalty (rather than -2). Its casting time
is also considerably shorter than the wizard spell.

Risk Decrement

When surrounded by lots of enemies and when most other warriors may fall or surrender in despair, a high level riskbreaker is more than capable to break the risk involved in the toughest situations. 

Risk decrement has the following effects:
- Heals the riskbreaker completely.
- Applies a massive crushing attack to all enemies around the riskbreaker which inflicts 5D10
  damage and throws them away. They should also save vs. spell with -10 penalty or become
  unconscious for one round.


Disadvantages:
- Cannot wear any armor.
- Cannot wear any helmet (other than Ioun stones).
- Cannot use gauntlets and shields.
- Cannot use ranged weapons.
- Cannot specialize in two handed weapons.
- Receives a -2 Penalty to constitution.
- Is immune to "Spirit Armor" and "Barkskin" spells.
- Requires 13 Dexterity and 12 Intelligence.
- Cannot dual class.

=======================================
Updating the mod from an older version:
=======================================
If you have an older version of Riskbreaker kit, you can udate it to the newer version in
this way:
1- Uninstall the older version of the mod.
2- Delete the folder "RBK" from your BG2 main folder.
3- Unzip the new version of the mod into your BG2 folder. If asked whether you want to replace
   anything, reply "yes". Now, you will have a new "RBK" folder.
4- Install the new version of the mod.
5- If You were already playing version 7, you won't need to start a new game after installing
   version 8, but if you had an older version than v7, then you will need to start a new game.
